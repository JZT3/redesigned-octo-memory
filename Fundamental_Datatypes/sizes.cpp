/*
 A single object may use 1,2,4,8 or more contiguous memory addresses.
 The amount of memory an object uses is determined by its data type.

 we typically access memory through variable names and not memory addresses


 The size of an object puts a limit on how many unique values it can store.
    objects that store more bytes can store larger num of unique values
 

Computers have finite memory.
everytime you define an object it is used for that lifetime


An object must take minimum 1 byte such that it can have a distinct memory address 
  a byte is at least 8 bits
  a memory byte is addressable (we can access every byte in memory independently)
  Floating point support is IEEE-754 compliant
  32 or 64 bit architecture


bool      1 byte
char
wchar_t
char8_t
char16_t
char32_t
