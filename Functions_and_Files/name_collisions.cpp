/*
C++ requires all identifiers to be unique (non-ambiguous)
if two identifiers are introduced into the same program, the compiler or linker will produce an error

this is a name collision.


Note: Two (or more) identically named functions (or global variables) are introduced in the same file it is a compile error!
      If the colliding identifiers are introduced into seperate files, but appear in the same program it is a linekr error.


Two or more functions or global variables can be delcared in different scopes without causing naming conflicts.


  A function body is a scope.
  NAMESPACES is another type of scope
