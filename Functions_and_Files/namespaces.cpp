/*
Global Namespace
  NO non-const global variable definition (with/without initializer)s
  No executable statements (assignment x=5)

STD Namespace
  '::' is called the Scope Resolution Operator.
  leftside is the namespace
  rightside is identifier that lives in said namespace

  It is better practice to use explicit namespace (std::cout)

  We should not use using-directive statements (using namespace...)
