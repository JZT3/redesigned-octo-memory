/*
 A process (informally is a running program)
    A program is just a bunch of instructions and static data on disk
    The operating system takes these bytes and gets them running.


 Although there are few physical CPUs available, the OS can provide the illusion of many

 When you want to run more than on programs the OS can virtualize the CPU
